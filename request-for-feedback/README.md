**File specification for chaining containerized computational software:**
Impact on achieving Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) 
Containerized Computational Software (FAIR-CCS) 

## Agency

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**

**Department of Commerce (DOC)**

## Action

**Request for Information (RFI)**

## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is evaluating and 
improving the specification for achieving interoperability of containerized 
computational software.  Adherence to a specification for 
**Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) Containerized 
Computational Software (FAIR-CCS)** enables better reuse of containerized tools 
in complex data analyses by chaining tools into computational workflows. 
NIST requests information from the community on approaches to achieving interoperability
of containerized software, designing a container manifest file that meets the community 
needs, and lowering the barrier for constructing such a manifest file. 
Responses to this RFI will also inform a possible revision of the current approach 
to achieving FAIR-CCS via a manifest file, the entries in the current manifest file 
specification of FAIR-CCS, and the current tools that aim at automating adherence 
to the FAIR-CCS manifest specification.

## Request For Information 

Respondents are encouraged – but are not required – to respond to each topic area and to present
their responses after each topic area. The following topic areas cover the major areas about 
which NIST seeks comment. Respondents may organize their submissions in response to this RFI 
in any manner. Responses may include estimates, which should be identified as such.
All relevant responses that comply with the requirements listed in the DATES and ADDRESSES 
sections of this RFI will be considered.

### NIST is requesting information related to the following topics:

1. Approaches to chain containerized computational software 
2. Important characteristics of sets of containerized computational software for reuse 
3. Methods to facilitate the characterization of containerized computational software  
4. Best practices for containerization of computational algorithms and for the interfaces between containerized algorithms accessing datasets in heterogeneous storage environments 
5. Best practices for finding containerized software tools and container-based workflows in online registries using application programming interfaces (APIs) 
6. Best practices for executing container-based workflows using workflow engines and job schedulers for computational resource management in distributed computational environments


## Supplementary Information

With the increasing popularity of software containers as standardized units for deployment, 
research communities have adopted the use of containerizing heterogeneous software 
(i.e., algorithms or tools or modules) and are running them on institutional or commercially 
available computer cluster, cloud, or high-performance computing (HPC) resources. 
For example, in biomedical microscopy imaging, stakeholders cope with very large datasets 
as the advancements in microscope designs and automated acquisition generate terabyte-size 
image collections in a relative short time span. Stakeholders also strive to reuse containerized 
tools and reproduce complex workflow analyses. Accordingly, there is an opportunity in biomedical
microscopy imaging to improve the reuse and reproducibility of analyses via specifications of 
interoperable containerized algorithms (i.e., computational tools or software plugins) in order to 
create container-based workflows (i.e., chained containerized algorithms). 

In a more general context, as working with software containers, heterogeneous file formats
and storage mechanisms, a variety of scientific workflow engines, distributed computational 
and storage environments, and application programming interfaces to metadata registries and 
ontologies involve complex analyses, the stakeholders are expected to be from academia, industry,
and government. 

Initially, NIST hosted the 1st workshop on Interoperability of Web Computational Plugins for Large Microscopy Image Analyses
[(URL)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2019/12/interoperability-web-computational-plugins-large-microscopy-image) in 2019.
The workshop report can be found [here](https://www.nist.gov/publications/interoperability-web-computational-plugins-large-microscopy-image-analyses).
In collaboration with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the specifications of a container manifest file have been expanded to accommodate 
additional bioimaging application needs.

Through this RFI, we seek inputs from the community on approaches 
- (a) to achieving interoperability of containerized software,
- (b) to designing a container manifest file that meets the community needs, 
and 
- (c) to lowering the barrier for constructing such a manifest file.
- 
Responses to this RFI will inform a possible revision of 
- (a) the current approach to achieving FAIR-CCS via a manifest file,
- (b) the entries in the current manifest file specification of FAIR-CCS,
- (c) the current tools that aim at automating adherence to 
the FAIR-CCS manifest specification.
