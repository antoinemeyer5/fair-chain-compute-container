**File specification for chaining containerized computational software:**
Impact on reuse of containerized software for Image Analytics use cases

## Agency

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**

**Department of Commerce (DOC)**

## Action

**Request for Feedback (RFF)**

## Summary

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking 
information to assist in evaluating and improving the specification for
achieving interoperability of containerized computational software. 
Adherence to a specification for 
**Interoperable Containerized Computational Software (ICCS)** 
enables much better reuse of containerized tools 
in complex data analyses by chaining tools into computational workflows.

Through this RFF, we seek inputs from the community on approaches 
- (a) to achieving interoperability of containerized software,
- (b) to designing a container manifest file that meets the community needs, 
and 
- (c) to lowering the barrier for constructing such a manifest file.

Initially, NIST hosted the 1st workshop on Interoperability of Web Computational Plugins for Large Microscopy Image Analyses
[(URL)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2019/12/interoperability-web-computational-plugins-large-microscopy-image) in 2019.
The workshop report can be found [here](https://www.nist.gov/publications/interoperability-web-computational-plugins-large-microscopy-image-analyses).
In collaboration with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the specifications of a container manifest file have been expanded to accommodate 
additional bioimaging application needs.

The public inputs provided in response to this RFF will inform 
the NIST team who will conduct the challenge and 
will be beneficial for the development of future challenges. 
We are particularly interested in alternative or complementary data sources, analytic approaches, and relevant policy domains as well as more general feedback on the tentative challenge process defined below.

Responses to this RFF will inform a possible revision 
of 
- (a) the current approach to achieving 
Interoperable Containerized Computational Software (ICCS) via a manifest file,
- (b) the entries in the current manifest file specification of ICCS,
- (c) the current tools that aim at automating adherence to 
the ICCS manifest specification. 

In addition, the responses will be discussed at the 2nd 
workshop on Interoperability of Web Computational Plugins for Large Microscopy Image Analyses
[(URL TBD)](TBD) planned to take place in December 2023.


## Date

Response Deadline: December 1st, 2023.

### Provide Your Feedback to the Following Questions

1. What approaches do you use to chain 
containerized computational software?
2. What are the most important characteristics of containerized computational software
for reuse?
3. What tools and template forms (or code snippets) do you use 
to facilitate the characterization of 
containerized computational software?
4. Are you interested in consolidating best practices for containerization of 
algorithms and interfaces between containerized algorithms and datasets in heterogeneous storage environments, 
5. Are you interested in defining application programming interfaces (APIs)
for finding containerized software tools and container-based workflows in registries, and 
6. What workflow engines and schedulers in distributed computational 
environments are critical in your work to support executions 
of container-based workflows?

## Stakeholders
With the increasing popularity of software containers as standardized units for deployment,
multiple research communities adopted the approach of containerizing heterogeneous software
(i.e., algorithms or tools or modules) and running them on institutional or commercially 
available computer cluster, cloud, or high-performance computing (HPC) resources. 
Biomedical microscopy imaging community is one of several stakeholder communities that 
- (a) copes with very large datasets as the advancements in microscope designs and automated acquisition
enabled generating terabyte-sized image collections in a relative short time 
spans and 
- (b) strives to reuse containerized tools and reproduce complex workflow analyses. 

In the context of biomedical microscopy imaging, there is an opportunity to improve
reuse and reproducibility of analyses via specifications of interoperable containerized 
algorithms (i.e., computational tools or software plugins) in order to enable 
creating container-based workflows (i.e., chained containerized algorithms). 

In a more general context, the stakeholders come from academia, industry, and government
as complex analyses involve working with software containers, 
heterogeneous file formats and storage mechanisms, 
a variety of scientific workflow engines, 
distributed computational and storage environments, and 
application programming interfaces to metadata registries and ontologies.
